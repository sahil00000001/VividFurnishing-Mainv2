font-fapastedDSNow we have to create another section in that section. Basically we need to show the testimonials, so. We should need to make a small animation at the background like the testimonials. Should be in bold firstly it is in bold and the dark in color and after that another testimony should be there like it should be like this the testimonial.testimonial.testimonial.testimony. But one is the darkest, another one will get fader. And last one is just a busy pulmonary. And this is how. Thao animation the carousel animation should be coming. The tech should be coming from the right hand side and disappear at the left hand side. This kind of animation should be there in the background and similarly the testing modules. This kind of animation run in the four rows. 5 rows. Similarly like that and in each row the folder text alignment should be different like. In first two testimonial darker one coming in the mid another and 2nd line it should get fast and 3rd line it should be at last. Something like that and all the things running at the same time. For the Lions running at the same time. These are the continuous animation that we have to make. And above that you need to show square boxes in which the name should be on top of the boxing. After that the rating will be there. And after that a small line and. After that. Description or the testimonials that a person gives. In top left of rectangle in In circle we have to show the images of a users. And. Around that image. We need to have an image. I'll show you how I want. The rectangle should be there. And the background animation should be there but the in front and down top these rectangles will be static and the stable. But at the background the animation should be rending this. Kind of animation. This kind of section so create a prompt for this in detail how to achieve this pulsar share one image. To get the better idea of things.EditEngineered dynamic testimonial section with layered background animationThe user wants to create a testimonials section with:

Background animation:

Multiple rows of the word "Testimonials" repeating
Text moves from right to left (carousel/marquee effect)
Different opacity levels (one darker, others fading)
5 rows with different timing/positions
Continuous animation running simultaneously


Foreground testimonial cards:

Static rectangular boxes on top of the animation
User image in a circle at the top-left corner of each rectangle
Name at the top of the box
Star rating below the name
A divider line
Testimonial text/description


Color scheme seems to be using brown/terracotta colors based on the CSS: rgba(88, 35, 8, various-opacity)

The user has also shared an image showing the layout with testimonial cards.
I'll create a detailed prompt for this section.Based on your requirements and the CSS/image provided, here's a comprehensive prompt for creating this animated testimonials section:

  100% { transform: translateX(-100%); }
}

.testimonial-row {
  animation: scrollTestimonials 20s linear infinite;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

.testimonial-row:nth-child(2) {
