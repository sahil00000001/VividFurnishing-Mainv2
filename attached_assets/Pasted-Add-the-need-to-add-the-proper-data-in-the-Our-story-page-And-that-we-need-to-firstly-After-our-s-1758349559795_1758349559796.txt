Add the need to add the proper data in the. Our story page. And that we need to firstly. After our story. We need to update the line Because a home is built not just with walls, but with warmth.. We will find this all this. And the. Later I'll share all this stuff with you, so update that line. Coming to the Our Journey section. In that after the our journey, update the line From family values to timeless furnishings — this is just the beginning of SM Furnishings..
hence update Storyline also.
"2003 – The First Step
After Dadu’s retirement as Sales Head of a government handloom cooperative, our family opened its first multi-brand home furnishings showroom in Hisar. It was more than a store — it was a place where people discovered fabrics that felt like home.

2018 – A Dream Expands
With years of dedication and trust, we grew to open our second showroom in Hisar. This was not just about expansion, but about becoming part of more homes and more stories.

2020 – Love & Legacy
We lost our guiding lights — Shakuntala Ji and Manohar Ji. But their values of warmth, elegance, and care stayed with us. It was in their memory that the seeds of SM Furnishings were sown.

2025 – A New Chapter
Carrying forward their legacy, the next generation launches SM Furnishings — a brand born from love, rooted in heritage, and made for modern homes."


After that we have to add a new section. The heading of the section will be.
"ADD THIS SECTION:

Why Shakuntala & Manohar?"

In the in that section write all this stuff.
"Our name isn’t just a name — it’s a promise.

- Shakuntala means “the one protected by virtue” — she embodied grace, warmth, and strength that turned every house into a home.

- Manohar means “the one who captivates the heart” — his eye for detail and love for quality touched everyone around him.

Together, they are the soul of SM Furnishings — comfort that protects you, and beauty that captures your heart."

Next we have to update our foundation Section.
"Mission
To make luxury furnishings accessible — blending timeless elegance with everyday comfort.

Vision
To become a household name in home furnishings by carrying forward a legacy rooted in love, quality, and trust.

Values
Heritage, affordability, and authenticity guide us — ensuring every piece feels personal, warm, and lasting."

After that we have to like update the content in what make us different section. That is also there. So update the content in this way.
"- Rooted in three generations of trust and craft.
- A legacy inspired by Shakuntala Ji’s warmth and Manohar Ji’s eye for quality.
- Luxury made minimal, timeless, and affordable.
- Every collection designed with comfort at its heart.
- A family-first brand, born out of love and memories.
- More than furnishings — it’s a feeling of home."
