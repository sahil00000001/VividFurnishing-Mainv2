Detailed Prompt for Creating the "Order in Bulk" Section for SM Furnishings
Overall Layout Structure
Create a two-column layout section with a 45-55 split ratio (form takes 45%, image composition takes 55%). The entire section should have a clean, luxury furniture aesthetic with terracotta/orange accent colors matching the SM Furnishings brand.
Section Header
Position: Centered at the top of the section
Main Title: "Order In Bulk?" - Use an elegant serif or modern sans-serif font, size 48-56px, dark brown color (#2C1810)
Subtitle: "Fill the form below to get in touch for bulk orders" - Lighter weight, size 16-18px, gray color (#666666)
Spacing: Add 20px margin below subtitle before the main content
Left Side - Contact Form Design
Form Container:

Background: Soft beige/cream color (#F5E6D3) with subtle transparency
Border radius: 15-20px for smooth, modern corners
Padding: 40px internal spacing
Box shadow: Subtle shadow (0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.08))

Form Fields Structure:

Full Name Field

Label: "Full Name" in uppercase, small size (12px), letter-spacing: 1px
Input: Clean border-bottom style only (no full border)
Placeholder: "Your full name" in light gray
Height: 45px with generous padding


Email Field

Same styling as name field
Placeholder: "yourname@example.com"
Add email validation indicators


Phone Number Field

Include country code selector if needed
Placeholder: "+91 98765 43210"
Number formatting as user types


Order Description Field

Textarea instead of input
Minimum 4 rows height
Placeholder: "Explain your order and requirements here..."
Resizable vertically only


Submit Button

Text: "Get In Touch"
Background: Terracotta/orange gradient (#AF4C0F to #D85A1F)
Full width or centered 200px width
Height: 50px
Border radius: 25px (pill-shaped)
Hover effect: Darken by 10% with smooth transition
Text: White, bold, 16px



Right Side - D-Shaped Image Composition
Main Structure - The "D" Shape:

Outer D Container:

Create a large D-shaped container using border-radius
Dimensions: Approximately 550px width × 700px height
Border-radius: Apply 350px to top-left and bottom-left, keep right side straight
This creates the curved left side of the "D"


Border Implementation:

Add a thick border (13-15px) in terracotta color (#AF4C0F)
Border should follow the D-shape perfectly
Consider using CSS clip-path or SVG for precise control


Image Placement:

Main furniture image should fill the D-shape
Use object-fit: cover to maintain aspect ratio
Position the most important part of the image in the visible area


Bottom Brown Bar:

Position: Absolute at the bottom of the D
Background: Dark brown (#582308)
Height: Approximately 120px
Width: Should extend from the curved edge to the straight edge
Box shadow: 0px 4px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25)
This creates a "shelf" or "ground" effect for the furniture


Inner Orange Circle Accent:

Create a circular border element
Position it to overlap the main image
Only show approximately 60-70% of the circle
Border color: Same terracotta (#AF4C0F)
Border width: 10-12px
This adds visual interest and frames a specific furniture piece



Responsive Design Considerations
Desktop (>1200px):

Maintain side-by-side layout
Full D-shape visible

Tablet (768px - 1200px):

Reduce D-shape size proportionally
Adjust form padding
Consider stacking if space is too tight

Mobile (<768px):

Stack vertically: Header → Form → D-shape image
Transform D-shape to a simpler rounded rectangle
Make form fields full-width
Reduce overall padding

Visual Effects & Interactions

Form Field Focus States:

Border-bottom changes to terracotta color
Subtle background highlight
Label floats up (if using floating labels)


Image Hover Effect:

Slight zoom (1.05 scale)
Subtle brightness increase
Smooth transition (0.3s ease)


Loading States:

Button shows spinner on submit
Form fields disable during submission
Success message appears in place of form

Implementation Tips

For the D-Shape: Use CSS combination of border-radius and overflow:hidden, or create an SVG mask for precise control
Image Quality: Use high-resolution furniture images (minimum 1200px width) with WebP format for performance
Accessibility: Ensure all form fields have proper labels, ARIA attributes, and keyboard navigation
Performance: Lazy load the image, optimize file sizes, use CSS transforms for animations instead of position changes

This design creates a sophisticated, modern bulk order section that aligns with luxury furniture branding while maintaining usability and visual appeal.
